## Prologue: 
For the past six months, I attempted to be intimate with AI overall but to no avail, especially in the LLM sector--the hot potato amongst all. 

I have completed the popular *Andrew Ng*'s **Deep Learning Specialization** in Coursera multiple times to obtain the intuition of basic AI network variants, such as FC Neural Nets, CNNs, and LLMs. 

I am (somewhat arrogant) to contend that I am confident in how the previous two networks. However, LLMs were a bit difficult initially to get a full grasp. Due to my shallow knowledge in linear algebra, calculus, and network structures, I still could not fully comprehend the anatomy of Attention albeit reading [*Attention is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) - hyperlinked for my utmost convenience for future reviews/reference. 

## 2025/04/19: Restart into LLMs
Currently serving my mandatory military service as a Korean man, I have brought a book [*Practical AI Application Development Utilizing LLMs*](https://github.com/onlybooks/llm) to my base (It's in Korean). Apparently, this book provides a thorough step-by-step guide to not only the LLM structure but also building on top of it. Contains both basics and applications: two sectors that I desired to achieve. 

### Why LLMs? 
I do not want to respond with a banal consensus of "it's changing the world". What I am more interested in is its interaction with the element of **text**, always used to express the genetic information/material of all organisms in existence. While I do not have a solid knowledge in biology (something that I plan to obtain in the future when I return to college after finishing my service), I thought it would be good to prepare ahead and study LLMs as it would help me detect opportunities to apply AI into medicine development, an industry I aim to participate in.
